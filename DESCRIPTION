Description: The most well-known regression models in the literature are based 
    on the assumption of normality. However, this assumption is not always 
    satisfied in practice. As a consequence, the present package aims 
    to develop the Chen quantile regression model, so a reparametrization 
    of the Chen distribution in terms of the quantile was developed and a 
    regression structure was inserted for its modeling.
